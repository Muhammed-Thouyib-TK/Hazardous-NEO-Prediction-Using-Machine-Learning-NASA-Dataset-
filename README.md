# ☄️ Hazardous NEO Prediction Using Machine Learning (NASA Dataset)

Binary classification of hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using NASA data and supervised machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

In this project, I developed a machine learning pipeline to predict hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using real-world astronomical data from NASA. With a focus on binary classification, the project walks through a complete ML workflow — from data cleaning to model evaluation — offering insights into how AI can support planetary defense and space research.

## 📌 Key Highlights of the Project

### ➡ Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Loaded NASA's Near-Earth Object dataset (1910–2024)  
- Dropped non-informative columns like `neo_id`, `name`, and `orbiting_body`  
- Encoded boolean features (`is_sentry_object`, `is_hazardous`) to numeric format  
- Cleaned dataset by handling nulls with `dropna()`  

### ➡ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized the class distribution of hazardous vs. non-hazardous objects  
- Detected class imbalance, revealing potential classification challenges  
- Used bar plots and summary statistics for feature understanding  

### ➡ Model Building
- Trained two supervised ML models:  
  🔹 Logistic Regression – Baseline linear model  
  🔹 Random Forest Classifier – Robust ensemble model  

### ➡ Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models using:  
  🔸 Accuracy Score  
  🔸 Confusion Matrix  
  🔸 Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
- ✅ Observed that Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression, especially in identifying hazardous objects (minority class)
